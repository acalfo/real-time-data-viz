Hi, 

This is my app for the JS Coding Challenge!

Steps to install & run:
First, cd into root directory

Then run the following commands: 
1) npm install   
2) bower install   
3) node server.js

Then open your browser & go to localhost:3000

***Configuration options for the app are located in QueryTimes.js 


Thanks,

Alex Calfo
